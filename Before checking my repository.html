Uhmmm,I am very sorry that to use such low way to explain my repository.

First,if you want to check my homework,there are some index you should know,
I named my file according to the time when we had training,while the exact one has an additional index.
For example,we had a training on November 2nd,and the homework about regular expression's index on the training file is 1.2.
So I named it h2_1.2,This is the most important you should know.
Second,NORMALLY,I add some question in my py file,so I will appreciate anyone who see them and offer me a helping hand.

That's all for now,for my poor english skills,if there are something impolite,I feel awfully apologized for it.
PLEASE point anything inappropriate out.
Thanks!!!
